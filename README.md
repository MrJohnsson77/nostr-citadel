# [Nostr Citadel - The Sovereign Relay | WiP](https://github.com/MrJohnsson77/nostr-citadel)  

Nostr Citadel, a personal relay that stores and safeguards all your nostr data.  

The idea is that anyone should be able to run a relay and manage their own data in a **simple** and convenient way.
Once you're up and running, the relay will actively sync data from other relays and create a backup locally.

By default, only admin data is synced to the relay.  
Unless set as public, only admin and whitelisted npubs are allowed to post to the relay.

Stay Sovereign ðŸ¤™

## Disclaimer
This is me learning [Nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr) and [Go](https://go.dev/).  
I will be adding the features that I'd like to see in a sweet relay.

Let me know if there's anything you'd like to see implemented.

No prior Go experience so use it at your own peril. ðŸ’€  
It should be [safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to use. 

There will be breaking changes up until v0.1.0

As Is - No Warranty!

## Requirements
- Computer
- Internet
- Courage

## Get Started
Download the config.yaml and the binary for your architecture from the [release](https://github.com/MrJohnsson77/nostr-citadel/releases) section.  
Add your npub and relay_url in the config.yaml and drop the config and executable in a folder and run.  

First start will create the database and bootstrap the relay by syncing the admin notes from other relays.
Initial list of relays is downloaded from [nostr.watch](https://api.nostr.watch/v1/online).

A specific bootstrap relay can be set in config.yaml, this relay will be added to the list of relays used during bootstrap.

Open the relay_url in a browser to verify that the relay is running.
Add your relay in your nostr client to connect and start saving your events.

Profiles of whitelisted users will be displayed on the dashboard, it can be disabled in config.yaml by setting `dashboard: false`  
If your profile doesn't show up on the dashboard, start any client and save your profile to push it to your relay.

### Operation
Changing admin_npub in config.yaml will replace the old admin with the new one.  
In this version a change of admin won't purge the events of the old admin, only delete the event with kind 0 (profile)

 *  Bind to specific port
    ```
    ./nostr-citadel start --port 1337 --loglevel INFO
    ```
  
  
  * Display whitelist
    ```
    # List whitelisted npubs  
    
    ./nostr-citadel whitelist --list
    ```

  * Add npub to whitelist
    ```
    ./nostr-citadel whitelist --add npub....
    ```

  * Remove npub from whitelist
    ```
    # Removing a npub from the whitelist will delete all events for it too.  
    
    ./nostr-citadel whitelist --remove npub....
    ```

  * Create invoice for npub
    ```
    ./nostr-citadel invoice --create npub....
    ```
    
  * Create QR Code invoice for npub
    ```
    ./nostr-citadel invoice --qr npub....
    ```
    
  * Verify if invoice is paid
    ```
    ./nostr-citadel invoice --verify npub....
    ```
