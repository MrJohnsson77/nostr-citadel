# [Nostr Citadel - The Sovereign Relay | WiP](https://github.com/MrJohnsson77/nostr-citadel)  

Nostr Citadel, a personal relay that stores and safeguards all your nostr data.  

The aim is to make running a relay and managing your data easy and accessible for everyone. 
Once you have set up your relay, it will automatically synchronize data from other relays and create a backup of your data locally, 
ensuring you never lose any events or notes.

By default, the relay will sync admin, paid, and whitelisted npubs. 
However, only admin, whitelisted, and paid npubs will have write access to the relay, unless you choose to set it as public in the configuration settings.

You can try it out by adding `wss://relay.nostr-citadel.org` to your relays.  
Stay Sovereign ðŸ¤™

## Disclaimer
This is me learning [Nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr) and [Go](https://go.dev/).  
I will be adding the features that I'd like to see in a sweet relay.

Let me know if there's anything you'd like to see implemented.

No prior Go experience, use it at your own peril. ðŸ’€  
It should be [safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to use. 

There will be breaking changes.  
As Is - No Warranty!

## Requirements
- Computer
- Internet
- Courage

## Get Started
Download the config.yaml and the binary for your architecture from the [release](https://github.com/MrJohnsson77/nostr-citadel/releases) section.  
Add your npub and relay_url in the config and drop the config and executable in a folder and start it.  

First start will create the database and bootstrap the relay by syncing the admin notes from other relays.
Initial list of relays is downloaded from [nostr.watch](https://api.nostr.watch/v1/online).

A specific bootstrap relay can be set in config.yaml, this relay will be added to the list of relays used during bootstrap.

Open the relay_url in a browser to verify that the relay is running.
Add your relay in your nostr client to connect and start saving your events.  
Profiles of whitelisted users will be displayed on the dashboard, it can be disabled in config.yaml by setting `dashboard: false`  

If your profile doesn't show up on the dashboard, start any nostr client and save your profile to push it to your relay.

### Operation
Changing admin.npub in config.yaml will replace the old admin with the new one.  
In this version a change of admin won't purge the events of the old admin, only delete the event with kind 0 (profile)

 *  Bind to port and select loglevel
    ```
    ./nostr-citadel start --port 1337 --loglevel INFO
    ```

  * Display whitelist
    ```
    # List whitelisted npubs  
    
    ./nostr-citadel whitelist --list
    ```

  * Add npub to whitelist
    ```
    ./nostr-citadel whitelist --add npub....
    ```

  * Remove npub from whitelist
    ```
    # Removing a npub from the whitelist will delete all events for it too.  
    
    ./nostr-citadel whitelist --remove npub....
    ```

  * Create invoice for npub
    ```
    ./nostr-citadel invoice --create npub....
    ```
    
  * Create QR Code invoice for npub
    ```
    ./nostr-citadel invoice --qr npub....
    ```
    
  * Verify if invoice is paid
    ```
    ./nostr-citadel invoice --verify npub....
    ```
