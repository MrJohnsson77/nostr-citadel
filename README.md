# [Nostr Citadel - The Sovereign Relay | WiP](https://github.com/MrJohnsson77/nostr-citadel)  

Nostr Citadel, a personal relay that stores and safeguard all your nostr data.  

The idea is that anyone should be able to run their own relay and manage their own data in a **simple** and convenient way.
Once you're up and running, the relay will actively sync data from other relays and create a backup locally.
 
By default, only admin data is synced to the relay.  
Only admin and whitelisted npubs are allowed to post to the relay.

Stay Sovereign ðŸ¤™

## Disclaimer
This is me learning [Nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr) and [Go](https://go.dev/).  
I will be adding all features that I want myself for a sweet relay.  

Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like to see implemented.

No prior Go experience so use it at your own peril. ðŸ’€  
It should be [safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to use. 

As Is - No Warranty!

## Requirements
- Computer
- Internet
- Courage

## Get Started
Source and binaries will be available soon...   
Contact me if you want to do some alpha testing.

### Configuration & Operation
Add your npub and citadel_url in the config.yaml.

On first startup, the npub set as admin will be bootstrapped by downloading the profile data from several default
relays, when the profile is downloaded the relay will sync using the relays in the profile.

Initial startup will sync last 7 days, this can be tweaked in the config.

### Run from binary
Download binary for your architecture from the [releases](https://github.com/MrJohnsson77/nostr-citadel/releases) section.

### Run from source
  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:MrJohnsson77/nostr-citadel.git
  $ cd nostr-citadel
  $ go run main --port 1337 
  ```

### Build from source
```
  $ git clone git@github.com:MrJohnsson77/nostr-citadel.git
  $ cd nostr-citadel
  $ make build
  ```
